        <p>My name is Nicole Roberts and I was born in El Centro, California in May of the year 1994. I was born to a Mexican father and a half German/half Norweigan mother.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a town called Mexicali in Baja California, Mexico. My first language was Spanish, however, I quickly learned English and grew up speaking both languages at home.</p>
        <p>When I was 17 I wanted to transfer to a school in the United States so that I would be able to go to Med School in the states. I moved to Seattle in 2013 to pursue a degree in Marine & Conservational Biology.</p>
        <p>In June of 2018 I quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Europe, never planning on coming back. I travelled to 11 countries and stayed a total of 4 months abroad. I came back in October of the same year and started working at Zulily as an Assistant Buyer.</p>
        <p>I am now pursuing further education in Software Engineering to be able to one day create software that will program buildings to be 100% self sustainable.</p>
